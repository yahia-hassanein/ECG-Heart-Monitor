# ECG-Heart-Monitor
A real time heart monitor using the AD8232. This design allows it to be used as an embedded microcontroller to acquire the output signal. The STM32F103C8 will be used along with The AD8232 to measure the electrical activity of the heart. This electrical activity will be transmitted and be charted as an ECG on a python code.
The Biomedical Sensor Pads will be attached on the correct locations of the human body through the sensor cables, while the other end will be connected to the AD8323. The Pulse will be transmitted through the OUTPUT pin as an Analog signal to the ADC of the STM32F. After the necessary analysis on the signal and converting it to digital one, the values will be sent to a Python code for plotting through a Serial Communication (UART). The Python code will receive the values through the Pyserial. After successfully receiving the values, they will be plotted in real time using matplotlib and animation libraries.
The user will be able to specify the value of the sampling frequency required for the ADC as well as both the COM Port and the Baudrate to start the conversion. The data will be collected for one minute while plotted on a graph. The collected data will be used to report the heart rate in bpm using the HeartPy library. The user will only deal with the graphical user interface that is implemented using the Tkinter library.
